Our Production Features the work of the following collaborators

4 - Ridwan
5 - Trill

Our Team developed the following use for the data set give our groups interest in cyber security and protection of data as well as our collective background in computer science and IT.
Our team looked the progression of scamming data and online resources to help create an updatable data set that will pull in from news and social media sources around Australia to further improve the threat recognition of everyday Australians - be they at home, business or abroad.

Our work showcases the use of recent data provided by fellow Australiasn to create a databse for users to compare notes on and to reveal, that they, too, are not alone when it comes to a particular SMS they were sent @ 6:37 am, or a funny email sent over the weekend.

Our production showcases the use of relatively new input to create a tool that is free for use and easy to use.  Enjoy!
