# TODO


- atributions / links for datasets (Ridwan - maybe some words of ML approaches you would take we can add to the data story)
- video/screen shots of web pages ?
- main powtoon as mp4 or similar (Chale) (Andy: I can stitch an audio file to video with ffmpeg if they are the same length if the PPoint thing doesn't work out)
- choose / approve README version
- submission requirement (see below) (Andy - I will try to address most of these via the git landing page and adjust the project page)
